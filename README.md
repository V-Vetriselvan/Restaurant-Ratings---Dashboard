## üìà Analysis & Insights

### 1. Rating Consistency and Gaps

- **Rating Trends Across Cuisines:** Shows the average ratings for food, service, and overall experience across different cuisine types (e.g., American, Italian, Bakery). Ratings appear remarkably consistent across all categories, hovering around **1.2** for overall and food, and slightly lower for service.
- **Comparison of Rating Gaps:** Plots the difference between overall, food, and service ratings across specific cities (Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, San Luis Potos√≠, Ciudad Victoria). This highlights cities where service or food quality might be lagging behind the overall perception.

### 2. Consumer Demographics and Behavior

- **Consumer Count by Age Distribution:** Illustrates that the vast majority of consumers providing ratings fall into the **20-24 age group**, with participation dropping sharply in older segments.
- **Donut - Smoker:** Shows the consumer base split by smoking status. A large majority of consumers **(78.99%) are non-smokers**, which is valuable demographic information for targeted marketing and lounge planning.
- **Occupation-Specific Rating Performance:** Breaks down average ratings by the consumer's occupation (**Employed, Student, Unemployed**). **Students** provide the highest average food rating (**1.46**), while **Unemployed** consumers gave a zero rating across the board, suggesting data gaps or specific biases.

### 3. Supply and Category Focus

- **Bar - Supply:** Uniformly shows **130** for all cuisine categories (American, Italian, Bakery, etc.). This likely indicates the total number of distinct restaurants available in the dataset for each category, or a constant supply metric for the analysis.

## üéØ Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Service Quality Focus:** Although ratings are consistent, investigate the minor dip in **Average Service Rating** across all cuisines (e.g., 1.1) and cities, as this is the most common area for improvement.
2.  **Target Young Consumers:** Given the dominance of the **20-24 age group** in the consumer count, prioritize marketing and menu adjustments that appeal to this demographic.
3.  **Investigate Rating Gaps:** Perform a deeper analysis on the specific cities identified in the 'Comparison of Rating Gaps' chart to understand why food or service ratings diverge from the overall rating.
4.  **Validate Unemployed Data:** Review the source data for the 'Unemployed' segment, as the zero rating is likely an anomaly that requires cleaning or exclusion for accurate metric reporting.
